    "Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru are two major cities in Malaysia. Both cities become a center of attention for residential, job employment, tourism, education, shopping and sports activity. Both cities are well known in Malaysia, and become the top choice for local and foreign communities.\n",

    "Brief information about both cities:\n",
